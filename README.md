# **Stock Market Prediction App**

This is a Python-based Stock Market Prediction App that predicts the stock price using the latest market data. The app uses popular data analysis and machine learning libraries for predicting and displaying the data properly to the user.

## **Libraries Used**

- ### **Pandas**

  Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library that allows you to perform data analysis tasks with ease. In this project, we use Pandas to read the stock market data from CSV files and prepare it for use by the machine learning models.

- ### **Matplotlib**

  Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library that allows you to create visualizations such as charts, graphs, and plots. In this project, we use Matplotlib to create charts that show the stock price trends over time.

- ### **Scikit-learn**

  Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library that provides a range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more. In this project, we use Scikit-learn to train and test our machine learning models for predicting stock prices.

- ### **NumPy**

  NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing with Python. In this project, we use NumPy to perform mathematical operations on the stock market data and prepare it for use by the machine learning models.

- ### **TensorFlow**

  TensorFlow is a popular open-source platform for building machine learning models. In this project, we use TensorFlow to build a deep learning model for predicting stock prices.

- ### **Tingo API**

  The Tingo API provides access to real-time and historical stock market data. In this project, we use the Tingo API to access the latest stock market data and use it to train and test our machine learning models. By using the Tingo API, we ensure that our predictions are based on the most recent data available.

## **Features of this project**

- The app provides an interactive user interface that allows users to enter the stock symbol of the company they want to predict the stock price for.
- The app uses the latest market data and machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices accurately.
- The app can predict stock prices for the next 30 days.
- The app uses the Tingo API to access the latest stock market data, ensuring that the predictions are based on the most recent data available.

## **Conclusion**

This project is a great example of how data analysis and machine learning can be used to predict stock prices accurately. By using the latest market data and machine learning algorithms, the app can provide accurate predictions for the next 30 days. The use of the Tingo API ensures that the app is always using the latest stock market data available. This project is a great way to showcase your skills in data analysis and machine learning and can be used as a starting point for future projects in this area.
